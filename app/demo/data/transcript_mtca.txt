0:00–5:00 — Opening & Framing

Charlie:
Alright, let’s jump in. Thanks again, Lauren. I think today is really about pressure-testing what this system could be, not just aesthetically, but functionally — how it supports students, coaches, and us operationally.

Lauren:
Absolutely. Today is less about pixel-perfect design and more about system structure, data flow, and ownership. We’re mapping how information lives, moves, and stays accurate over time.

Kim:
That’s helpful. Especially since our biggest pain point right now is information living in too many places — spreadsheets, emails, third-party tools.

5:00–12:00 — Core Problem Statement

Lauren:
Let me restate the core problem as I understand it. Right now, students are tracking their college audition process across multiple disconnected tools — College Planner Pro, Google Docs, notes apps — while MTCA staff is separately tracking advising context. That creates duplication, drift, and confusion.

Charlie:
Exactly. And worse, it undermines trust in the system. Students don’t know which source of truth to rely on.

Kim:
And from our side, we’re constantly re-answering questions because we don’t have visibility into what a student has already researched or completed.

Lauren:
So the system we’re proposing becomes a single source of truth, but with clear ownership boundaries — what’s student-reported versus MTCA-provided.

12:00–20:00 — College List Architecture

Lauren:
The College List is the backbone. Structurally, it’s a Kanban-style board where each card represents a school + program combination.

Each card has:

Program metadata (degree type, audition requirements)

Deadlines

Status

Tasks (both auto-generated and user-added)

Charlie:
One concern I have — what about students applying to multiple programs at the same school?

Lauren:
Great question. Architecturally, we treat each program application as its own entity, even if the school overlaps. That avoids edge-cases where deadlines or requirements diverge.

Kim:
So Juilliard MT and Juilliard Acting would be two cards?

Lauren:
Exactly. Same parent institution, separate application objects.

20:00–28:00 — Task System & Ownership

Lauren:
Tasks fall into two categories:

MTCA-scaffolded tasks — required steps we know every student must complete

Student-created tasks — personal reminders or prep items

Students can opt out of MTCA scaffolding if appropriate, but by default it’s on.

Charlie:
That’s important. I don’t want this to feel like micromanagement, but structure helps most students.

Kim:
How do we prevent students from deleting required tasks?

Lauren:
We can lock MTCA-required tasks while still allowing students to mark them complete or add notes.

28:00–35:00 — Timeline & Milestones

Lauren:
Above the Kanban view, there’s a timeline showing macro milestones:

Research

Academics

Materials

Training

Pre-screens

Auditions

Decisions

Each phase unlocks contextually based on date and completion status.

Charlie:
I like that. It visually reinforces progress.

Kim:
Can students jump ahead?

Lauren:
Yes, but with guardrails. For example, they can view later stages, but the system flags missing prerequisites.

35:00–42:00 — Permissions & Roles

Lauren:
Roles matter here. We’re modeling:

Student

Coach

Admin

MTCA Director

Each role has different visibility and edit permissions.

Charlie:
For example, coaches shouldn’t edit deadlines, but they should see student progress.

Lauren:
Exactly. Deadlines are system-controlled. Coaches add qualitative feedback, not structural data.

Kim:
And parents?

Lauren:
Optional read-only role. We can phase that in later.

42:00–48:00 — Data Integrity & Reporting

Lauren:
Everything we’re building is reportable. You’ll be able to answer questions like:

How many students are behind on materials?

Which schools are most commonly applied to?

Where students tend to stall in the process?

Charlie:
That’s huge. Right now we’re flying blind.

Kim:
Could this eventually inform programming decisions?

Lauren:
Absolutely. That’s one of the long-term benefits of owning your data.

48:00–54:00 — Rollout Strategy

Charlie:
What does rollout look like? We can’t flip a switch overnight.

Lauren:
Phase 1 is internal validation with a small cohort. Phase 2 is opt-in students. Phase 3 is default adoption.

We’ll also import existing College Planner data where feasible, but we won’t force it.

Kim:
Training will be key.

Lauren:
Agreed. The UI should reduce training burden, but we’ll also include walkthroughs.

54:00–60:00 — Decisions & Next Steps

Charlie:
I’m aligned with the direction. This feels like the right foundation.

Kim:
Same. I’d like to see how the junior events piece ties in next.

Lauren:
Perfect. I’ll document today’s decisions and prep next steps.

Explicit Decisions Made

MTCA will move forward with a unified College List CRM platform

Each school + program combination will be modeled as a distinct application entity

MTCA-scaffolded tasks will be locked by default

Timeline phases will guide but not hard-block student progress

Coaches will have read-only access to structural data

Action Items (Intentionally Rich for Demo)

Lauren to deliver written system architecture summary for the College List feature

Lauren to share updated mockups reflecting program-level application cards

Charlie to review and confirm task ownership rules (locked vs editable)

Kim to compile a list of required MTCA-scaffolded tasks

Lauren to draft permission matrix for all user roles

Schedule follow-up meeting with Leo to finalize junior events integration

Identify pilot student cohort for Phase 1 rollout

Define reporting metrics MTCA leadership wants access to in v1
